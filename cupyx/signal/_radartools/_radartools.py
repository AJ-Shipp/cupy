    Pulse Compression is used to increase the range resolution and SNR
    by performing matched filtering of the transmitted pulse (template)
    with the received signal (x)

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Received signal, assume 2D array with [num_pulses, sample_per_pulse]

    template : ndarray
        Transmitted signal, assume 1D array

        Normalize transmitted signal

    window : array_like, callable, string, float, or tuple, optional
        Specifies the window applied to the signal in the Fourier
        domain.

    nfft : int, size of FFT for pulse compression. Default is number of
        samples per pulse
